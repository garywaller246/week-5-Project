=== Extending the Recipes/Cocktails project ===

Here are a few suggestions for extending the project.
Please only attempt these once you've implemented all the basic requirements.

* Delete recipe/cocktail feature - Part 1
	You'll need a new route, of course.
	Redirect to the main page.

* Delete recipe/cocktail feature - Part 2
	We should do some validation before deleting:
		- If the recipe doesn't belong to the user, should we allow deletion?
	If validation failed, display a flash message indicating why.

* Recipe popularity:
	Every time a recipe is viewed, record this in the database.
	List recipes sorted by popularity.

* Recipe category
	Add a field to the recipe/cocktail table for a category. Give it a text data-type.
	Allow a user to type in a category when adding a new recipe.
	On the recipes page, indicate recipe category. Either:
	  - as a badge/label for each row, or
	  - by dividing the page into sections - one section per category. Group recipes by their category on the page.
